// Package manifest defines the public schema for a connector manifest.
//
// A manifest describes *how* to talk to a kind of upstream MCP server:
//   - how it authenticates (PAT, OAuth2, ...)
//   - what command spawns it
//   - which credential keys map to which env vars at spawn time
//   - which metadata a profile can carry (for workspace autodetection)
//   - how to auto-detect which profile fits a workspace
//
// Manifests are pure data; they contain no secrets. Credentials live in the
// vault per profile.
package manifest

// AuthMode identifies how a connector authenticates.
type AuthMode string

	// AuthPAT — user pastes a long-lived personal access token. The PAT
	// is stored in the vault and injected into the child process via env.
	AuthPAT AuthMode = "pat"

	// the OAuth dance itself; it spawns mcp-remote as a bridge and hands
	// it an isolated auth directory per profile.
	AuthOAuth AuthMode = "oauth"
)

// Transport is how the gateway talks to the upstream MCP server.
